slice your stl files in the cloud!
slicing stl files on my laptop running linux is a pain in the ass, so I've longed wish for a website where I could. I have now made that website! The website allows anyone from anywhere to upload an stl file and get the sliced gcode file back. This opens up slicing to many users that wouldn't normally be able to: people using mobile phones, people using chromebooks, people who are lazy and running linux.
